# Nate's (Pretty) Website
## Using base code courtesy of CeeVee

The following repository holds all files & content relating to the deployment & development of Nathan Hall's official personal website.

Please feel free to use any of my code/files for your own needs as necessary.

CeeVee provided me with the base template files to create this pretty website. I modified these base files according to my own needs, adding my own information and customizing each section.
